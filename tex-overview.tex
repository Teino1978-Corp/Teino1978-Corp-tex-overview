In the world of \TeX, there are many developments and ambiguous names. This paper tries to give an overview of the development of \TeX\ and related programs. Contributions are welcome!\footnote{The current source of this document is availble at \url{http://github.com/alt/tex-overview}. Please feel free to patch there or mail me any suggestions and comments. I'll be happy to extend and correct this document!}\\
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The base frame and main idea of this document was taken from the article \textsf{A brief history of \TeX,~volume~II} by Arthur Reutenauer in the proceedings of \textsf{EuroBacho\TeX 2007} and his talk there (see references). Additional information is taken from original documentations (see references on page \pageref{sec:refs}) and some review articles. For old, historic information, the \textsf{historic archive} maintained by Ulrik Vieth and hosted on \url{ftp.tug.org} (see refs) was very useful. Many thanks for that great archive!

All information is up to the date of this generated pdf. Everything here is without guarantee – this is just to get an overview. Consult the references for further (and/or correct) information! 

In the tree views (page \pageref{sec:tree}), every node has a tooltip that shows up when you hover the mouse over it. If your pdf viewer does not support this, go to the end of the document, where every tooltip is written in normal text (page \pageref{sec:text}).

\clearpage
I tried to make the graphs more readable by using colors. All decisions reflect my personal opinion, not that of the community, of the authors or someone else.
\begin{description}
\item[{\let\nodecolor\normalimportant \tikz \node[coolnode]{normal};}] That is, not very important in my opinion, no huge user group, but still maybe important for special needs. Was in use at least some time back, but is not of great impact nowadays.
\item[{\let\nodecolor\vip \tikz \node[coolnode]{important};}] Engines or formats that had or have a great impact on (everyday) typesetting for a large community.
\item[{\let\nodecolor\experimental \tikz \node[coolnode]{experimental};}] Developments that might still be under construction or were never used by a large community. Nevertheless, these might be very important to the development of other engines or for use of special typesetting.
\item[{\let\nodecolor\package \tikz \node[coolnode]{package};}] \LaTeX-packages that seemed worth mentioning. There won't be many of this. Not-included packages are not necessarily unimportant!
\item[{\let\nodecolor\distro \tikz \node[coolnode]{distribution};}] Software bundles that bring \TeX\ and friends to the normal user.
\item[{\let\nodecolor\program \tikz \node[coolnode]{program};}] Programs that are not directly connected to \TeX\ (but interesting in the context of using \TeX) or are separate helper programs.
\end{description}

Furthermore, there are two versions of some graphs: A short version mentioning only the most important things and a full one with everything I could find.

In most cases I did not mention the authors of the programs/packages. This is not to diminish their effort but only for clarity (long names make things harder to read). I did not write any of the below-mentioned programs or packages. The authors are given in the documents linked in the references.

\section{How to contribute}
I hope one day this document would become the standard reference for questions like ”What program do I need for …?“, ”What's the difference between ...\TeX\ and ...\TeX?“, ”Why is it called …?“ etc.

To get to this point, I need some help of people having read more documentation or even developed some of the programs mentioned here themselves. Special help is needed for:
\begin{itemize}
\item font technologies
\item METAFONT and succesors
\item Bib\TeX\ and successors/alternatives
\end{itemize}

It is up to you to contribute texts, references, links, descriptions, hints etc. I'll be happy about anything I can add here. Also, if you have suggestions about the layout, let me know.

\section{Problems with pdf viewers}
As this document makes heavy use of pdf-features, some pdf viewers are not able to show everything correct and as intended. My experiences with viewers are as follows:

\begin{description}
\item[evince] Shows the document correct and complete. Tested using Linux.

\item[Acrobat Reader] will show all the information but might hide some text of very long tooltips (at least that's the case on my machine). Also, it draws annoying green boxes around the tooltips which do not belong there.

\item[TeXworks] The built-in pdf viewer of the TeXworks editor does not break lines of tooltips, therefore long annotations are not shown completely.

\item[okular] also does not break the lines.

\item[xpdf] shows only very short tooltips. Most of the information is not visible in the graphs.
