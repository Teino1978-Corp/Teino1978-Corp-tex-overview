\title{A short overview of \TeX, its children and their friends \dots}
\author{Arno Trautmann\thanks{arno.trautmann@gmx.de – Please feel free to mail me any suggestions and comments!}}
\date{\today}
\pagestyle{empty}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper tries to give a short overview of the development of \TeX. The base frame is taken from the article \textsf{A brief history of \TeX, volume II} by Arthur Reutenauer in the proceedings of \textsf{EuroBacho\TeX 2007} and his talk there (see references). Additional information is taken from original documentations (see references on page \pageref{sec:refs}) and some review articles. For old, historic information, the \textsf{historic archive} maintained by Ulrik Vieth and hosted on ftp.tug.org (see refs) was very useful. Many thanks for that great archive!

All information is up to the date of the generated pdf. Everything here is without guarantee – this is just to get an overview. Consult the references for further (and/or correct) information! 

In the tree views (page \pageref{sec:tree}), every node has a tooltip that shows up when you hover the mouse over it. If your pdf viewer does not support this, go to the end of the document, where every tooltip is written in normal text (page \pageref{sec:text}). I tried to make the graph more readable by using colors:

\begin{description}
\item[{\color[rgb]{\normalimportant} normal}] (whatever that means)
\item[{\color[rgb]{\vip} important}] developments (only in my opinion) – i.\,e. engines or distributions that had or have a great impact on (everyday) typesetting for a large community
\item[{\color[rgb]{\experimental} experimental}] developments that might still be under construction or were never used by a large community. Nevertheless, these might be very important to the development of other enginges or for use of special typesetting. \item[{\color[rgb]{\other} other}] programs that are not directly connected to \TeX\ but are interesting in the overview, are given in black.
\end{description}
\end{abstract}

Furthermore, there are two versions of each graph: A short version mentioning only the most important things and a full one with everything I could find.

In most cases I did not mention the authors of the programs/packages. This is not to diminish ther effort but only for clarity (long names make things harder to read). I did not write any of the below-mentioned programs or packages. The authors are given in the documents linked in the references.
