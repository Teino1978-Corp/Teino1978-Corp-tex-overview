In the world of \TeX, there are many developments and ambiguous names. This paper tries to give an overview of the development of \TeX\ and related programs. Contributions are welcome!\footnote{The current source code of this document is availble at \url{http://github.com/alt/tex-overview}. Please feel free to patch there or mail me any suggestions and comments. I'll be happy to extend and correct this document!}
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The base frame and main idea of this document was taken from the article \textit{A brief history of \TeX,~volume~II} by Arthur Reutenauer in the proceedings of \textsf{EuroBacho\TeX 2007} and his talk there (see~references on page~\pageref{sec:refs}). Additional information is taken from original documentations and some review articles. For old, historic information, the \textsf{historic~archive} maintained by Ulrik Vieth and hosted on \url{ftp.tug.org} (see~refs) was very useful, especially in the reconstruction of \LaTeX\ versions. Many thanks for that great archive!

All information is up to the date of this generated PDF and up to the information I found. Everything here is without guarantee – this is just to get an overview. Consult the references for further (and/or~correct) information! 

In the tree views, every node has a tooltip that shows up when you hover the mouse over it. For the case that your PDF viewer does not support this, there is a list of all the descriptions on page~\pageref{sec:text}.

\newpage
\section{How to read this document}
This document consists of several graphs showing the development of software more or less directly related to \TeX. The graphs try to show the time  development (downwards), as well as dependencies, changes, etc.

I tried to make the graphs more readable by using colors for different categories. The decisions about what is important and what is “normal” reflect my personal opinion only.

\begin{description}
\item[{\let\nodecolor\normalimportant \tikz \node[coolnode]{normal};}] That is, not very important in my opinion, no huge user group, but still maybe important for special needs. Was used by a major community at least some time back, but is not of great impact nowadays.

\item[{\let\nodecolor\vip \tikz \node[coolnode]{important};}] Engines or formats that had or have a great impact on (everyday) typesetting for a large community.

\item[{\let\nodecolor\experimental \tikz \node[coolnode]{experimental};}] Developments that might still be under construction or were never used by a large community. Nevertheless, these might be very important to the development of other engines or for use of special typesetting.

\item[{\let\nodecolor\package \tikz \node[coolnode]{package};}] \LaTeX-packages or single \TeX-files (useable as packages or modules) that seemed worth mentioning. There won't be many of this; most very important packages won’t be mentioned.

\item[{\let\nodecolor\distro \tikz \node[coolnode]{distribution};}] Software bundles that bring \TeX\ and friends to the normal user.

\item[{\let\nodecolor\histdistro \tikz \node[coolnode]{hist. dist.};}] Historical distributions that have no use today but were important for bringing TeX to older computer systems.

\item[{\let\nodecolor\program \tikz \node[coolnode]{program};}] Programs that are not directly connected to \TeX\ (but interesting in the context of using \TeX) or are separate helper programs.

\item[{\let\nodecolor\fonttechnology \tikz \node[coolnode]{font};}] Something related to a font. Neither a program nor libraries that provide access to fonts nor the actual files, but rather the abstract definition or specification.

\end{description}

Some graphs are quite complex, which is the reason why there are two versions of them: A short one mentioning only the most important things and a full version with everything I could find.

In most cases I did not mention the authors of the programs/packages. This is not to diminish their effort but only for brevity (long names make things harder to read). I did not write any of the below-mentioned programs or packages. The authors are given in the documents linked in the references.

\section{How to contribute}
I hope one day this document would become the standard reference for questions like ”What program do I need for …?“, ”What's the difference between ...\TeX\ and ...\TeX?“, ”Why is it called …?“ etc.

To get to this point, I need some help of people having read more documentation or even developed some of the programs mentioned here themselves. Special help is needed for:
\begin{itemize}
\item font technologies
\item METAFONT and succesors
\item Bib\TeX\ and successors/alternatives
\end{itemize}

It is up to you to contribute texts, references, links, descriptions, hints etc. I'll be happy about anything I can add here. Also, if you have suggestions about the layout, let me know.

\section{Problems with PDF viewers}
As this document makes heavy use of PDF-features, some PDF viewers are not able to show everything correct and as intended. My experiences with viewers are as follows:

\begin{description}
\item[evince] Shows the document correct and complete. Tested using Linux.

\item[Acrobat Reader] will show all the information but might hide some text of very long tooltips (at least that's the case on my machine). Also, it draws annoying green boxes around the tooltips which do not belong there.

\item[TeXworks] The built-in PDF viewer of the TeXworks editor does not break lines of tooltips, therefore long annotations are not shown completely.

\item[okular] also does not break the lines.

\item[xpdf] shows only very short tooltips. Most of the information is not visible in the graphs.

\item[gv] shows no tooltips, but the annoying green boxes. (Linux)
\end{description}
