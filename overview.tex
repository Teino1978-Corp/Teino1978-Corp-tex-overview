\maketitle

This paper tries to give a short overview of the development of \TeX. So far, most of the information is from the article \textsf{A brief history of \TeX, volume II} by Arthur Reutenauer in \textsf{EuroBacho\TeX 2007}.

\section*{\TeX\ -- the program}

\mynode{xet--tex}{3,0}{TeX--XeT was able to really put the glyphs on the right place in the dvi.}{\TeX-\relax{}-\XeT}

\draw (xet--tex) to (etex);

\mynode{pdftex}{6,-2}{A new engine to directly produce pdf-files from TeX, without the need of dvi-ps-pdf. This allows to use microtypographic extensions and many other features of the pdf format.}{pdf\TeX};

\mynode{xetex}{8,-4}{Originally started as a project for Mac OS, this quite young extension enables extremely multilingual support for left-to-right typesetting, right-to-left and almost any other possible directio. XeTeX also features support for OpenType and AAT-fonts.}{\XeTeX};
