\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper tries to give a short overview of the development of \TeX. The base frame is taken from the article \textsf{A brief history of \TeX, volume II} by Arthur Reutenauer in the proceedings of \textsf{EuroBacho\TeX 2007} and his talk there (see references). Additional information is taken from original documentations (see references on page \pageref{sec:refs}) and some review articles. For old, historic information, the \textsf{historic archive} maintained by Ulrik Vieth and hosted on ftp.tug.org (see refs) was very useful. Many thanks for that great archive!

All information is up to the date of the generated pdf. Everything here is without guarantee -- this is just to get an overview. Consult the references for further (and/or correct) information!

In the tree views (page \pageref{sec:tree}), every node has a tooltip that shows up when you hover the mouse over it. If your pdf viewer does not support this, go to the end of the document, where every tooltip is written in normal text (page \pageref{sec:text}). I tried to make the graph more readable by using colors:

\begin{description}
\item[{\color[rgb]{\normalimportant} normal}] (whatever that means)
\item[{\color[rgb]{\vip} important}] developments (only in my opinion) -- i.\,e. engines or distributions that had or have a great impact on (everyday) typesetting for a large community
\item[{\color[rgb]{\experimental} experimental}] developments that might still be under construction or were never used by a large community. Nevertheless, these might be very important to the development of other enginges or for use of special typesetting. \item[{\color[rgb]{\other} other}] programs that are not directly connected to \TeX\ but are interesting in the overview, are given in black.
\end{description}
